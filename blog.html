    <h3 class="blog-title">Part 2. Almost Middle of October</h3>
    <p class="blog-entry">Finally I'm done with CSS. Took a lot of work and practice. Need now to fix this website (at least a part of css code for now because there are so many other things that I need to do other than study). But I also have a badge now in CSS as well. Next is bootstrap and then finally Javascript, can't wait!</p>

    <h3 class="blog-title">Part 1. Beginning of October</h3>
<p class="blog-entry">
  Started to learn CSS (before that, the website was all written in htlm). It's interesting.
  I have the background in CSS/HTML because I used to do a lot of blogging. But the problem is that I have some knowledge and exposure; but I didn't have a lot of knowledge that I would have been looking for a job in this field before I started taking Web Development Course. But it makes everything easier than it is, so that's one of the reasons why I'm very fast at learning all of this.
  <br>Finished first CSS module today. I everything is very very easy for me so far and very interesting.
  <br> I think the biggest challenge will be later with finding another project, other than my website while I'm looking for a job.
  <br> Trying to look at different website that other front end developer's have. And I'm astonished! Some of those websites are so cool that I didn't think I could make something like this. I want to be creative as well.

    <h3 class="blog-title">Part 2. September, 2021</h3>
    <p class="blog-entry">Yay! I completed the fundamentals of the html course! I feel drained to be honest. Studying almost non-stop for 2 days straight. Might study less in the next couple of days.
    <br>But! I also learned a LinkedIn badge in LinkedIn that I know HTML. That's an accomplishment!
  <br>My next day for sure was an easy day. But now I'm more off to CSS and hopefully my website will look much better now.
<br>I have a goal in my head that I want to pursue (other than finding a job, more of a personal goal), so I want to get to it as fast as I can. </p>

    <h3 class="blog-title">Part 1. September, 2021</h3>
    <p class="blog-entry">Today I'm crushing HTML course that I've purchased on one of the websites where you learn new IT stuff. This stuff excites me.
      <br>First, I thought that I will be sitting and learning only for 20 minutes a day, but now I'm actually trying to learn whenever I have free time.</br>
    <br>Maybe I'm on the path to become a computer geek?</p>
