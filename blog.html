    <h3>Part 1. Beginning of October</h3>
<p>
  Started to learn CSS (before that, the website was all written in htlm). It's interesting.
  I have the background in CSS/HTML because I used to do a lot of blogging. But the problem is that I have some knowledge and exposure, but not that much. But it makes everything easier than it is, so that's one of the reasons why I'm very fast at learning all of this.

    <h3>Part 2. September, 2021</h3>
    <p>Yay! I completed the fundamentals of the html course! I feel drained to be honest. Studying almost non-stop for 2 days straight. Might study less in the next couple of days.
    <br>But! I also learned a LinkedIn badge in LinkedIn that I know HTML. That's an accomplishment!
  <br>My next day for sure was an easy day. But now I'm more off to CSS and hopefully my website will look much better now.
<br>I have a goal in my head that I want to pursue (other than finding a job, more of a personal goal), so I want to get to it as fast as I can. </p>

    <h3>Part 1. September, 2021</h3>
    <p>Today I'm crushing HTML course that I've purchased on one of the websites where you learn new IT stuff. This stuff excites me.
      <br>First, I thought that I will be sitting and learning only for 20 minutes a day, but now I'm actually trying to learn whenever I have free time.</br>
    <br>Maybe I'm on the path to become a computer geek?</p>
