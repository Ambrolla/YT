    <p>Today I'm crushing HTML course that I've purchased on one of the websites where you learn new IT stuff. This stuff excites me.
      <br>First, I thought that I will be sitting and learning only for 20 minutes a day, but now I'm actually trying to learn whenever I have free time.</br>
    <br>Maybe I'm on the path to become a computer geek?</p>
